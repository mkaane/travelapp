-nodemon is a tool that restarts the backend server after a change is done
-dotenv is a library that ensures us to hide secret informations such as database password and name, it helps us to hide these informations
from others like when we pushing on github.
-user.js line 22: timestamps:true means if we create or edit a user, it will automatically updated.
-on routes, for example conts Pin = require("../models/Pin") means that we import that model.
-there are async function like save or etc. That means this operations take time. so, like create a pin function, we should define the 
function async and when we send response, code should wait the save operation to finish, so we should use await before send response. 
(pins.js line:10)
-useEffect on frontend app.js: this means when we refresh the page, it will fetch with backend server
useEffect(() => {}, []) empty [ ] means it has not got a condition, every time we refresh, it gonna work
